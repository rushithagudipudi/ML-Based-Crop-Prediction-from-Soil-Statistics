# Dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset 

# Attributes
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil

P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil

K - ratio of Potassium content in soil

temperature - temperature in degree Celsius

humidity - relative humidity in %

ph - ph value of the soil

rainfall - rainfall in mm

# Why ML-Based-Crop-Prediction is necessary
ML-Based Crop Prediction from Soil Statistics is necessary because, unlike humans who cannot determine the best crop for bare land, machine learning can analyze soil data to recommend optimal crops. This technology improves agricultural productivity by making informed decisions based on soil health and environmental factors. It ultimately enhances food security and resource management.
